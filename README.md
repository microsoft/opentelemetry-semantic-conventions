Semantic Conventions define a common set of (semantic) attributes which
provide meaning to data when collecting, producing and consuming it.

> [!NOTE]

> This is a Microsoft fork of [OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions).
> It does NOT intend to replace OTel conventions and does NOT define any official
> conventions.
>
> It's intended for experimentation and prototyping large changes within a company
> before bringing them to the upstream repo.
>
> This repository is primarily used for draft Azure AI Inference and Agents conventions.
>
> If you want to define semantic conventions for your projects unrelated to Azure AI,
> please contribute them directly to OpenTelemetry.

<!-- tocstop -->

A request to an Generative AI is modeled as a span in a trace.

**Span kind:** SHOULD be `CLIENT`. It MAY be set to `INTERNAL` on spans representing
call to models running in the same process.
It's RECOMMENDED to use `CLIENT` kind when GenAI system being instrumented usually
runs in a different process than its client or when GenAI call happens over
instrumented protocol such as HTTP.

## Name

GenAI spans MUST follow the overall [guidelines for span names](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/v1.43.0/specification/trace/api.md#span).
The **span name** SHOULD be `{gen_ai.operation.name} {gen_ai.request.model}`.
Semantic conventions for individual GenAI systems and frameworks MAY specify different span name format.

### Status

Refer to the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document for
details on how to record span status.

## GenAI attributes

These attributes track input data and metadata for a request to a GenAI model. Each attribute represents a concept that is common to most Generative AI clients.
Many of these attributes only apply to specific GenAI operations. For example, GenAI embeddings requests don't use output tokens, so `gen_ai.usage.output_tokens` does not apply to embeddings operations.

**[1] `gen_ai.operation.name`:** If one of the predefined values applies, but specific system uses a different name it's RECOMMENDED to document it in the semantic conventions for specific GenAI system and use system-specific name in the instrumentation. If a different name is not documented, instrumentation libraries SHOULD use applicable predefined value.

**[2] `gen_ai.system`:** The `gen_ai.system` describes a family of GenAI models with specific model identified
by `gen_ai.request.model` and `gen_ai.response.model` attributes.

The actual GenAI product may differ from the one identified by the client.
Multiple systems, including Azure OpenAI and Gemini, are accessible by OpenAI client
libraries. In such cases, the `gen_ai.system` is set to `openai` based on the
instrumentation's best knowledge, instead of the actual system. The `server.address`
attribute may help identify the actual system in use for `openai`.

For custom model, a custom friendly name SHOULD be used.
If none of these options apply, the `gen_ai.system` SHOULD be set to `_OTHER`.

**[3] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the error code returned by the Generative AI provider or the client library,
the canonical name of exception that occurred, or another low-cardinality error identifier.
Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

**[4] `gen_ai.output.type`:** This attribute SHOULD be used when the client requests output of a specific type. The model may return zero or more outputs of this type.
This attribute specifies the output modality and not the actual output format. For example, if an image is requested, the actual output could be a URL pointing to an image file.
Additional output format details may be recorded in the future in the `gen_ai.output.{type}.*` attributes.

**[5] `gen_ai.output.type`:** when applicable and if the request includes an output format.

**[6] `gen_ai.request.model`:** The name of the GenAI model a request is being made to. If the model is supplied by a vendor, then the value must be the exact name of the model requested. If the model is a fine-tuned custom model, the value should have a more specific name than the base model that's been fine-tuned.

**[7] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[8] `gen_ai.agent.description`:** If available.

Agent name is usually available only on the agent-related operations
such as `create_agent`.

**[9] `gen_ai.agent.id`:** If available.

`gen_ai.agent.id` is usually available on the spans that describe operations
performed on the agent such as `create_agent` or `process_thread_run`.

Instrumentations of the low level GenAI inference operations such as
`chat` or `text_completion` done by the lower-level clients usually
don't have agent id available. If it's available, it SHOULD be set.

**[10] `gen_ai.agent.name`:** If available.

Agent name is usually available only on the agent-related operations
such as `create_agent`.

**[11] `gen_ai.message.id`:** For inference operations such as `chat` or `text_completion`, it SHOULD be the completion identifier returned by the GenAI system and may not be unique if multiple choices are returned.
If message history is managed by the application, agent, or framework, it SHOULD match the identifier used by the message history management system.

**[12] `gen_ai.request.encoding_formats`:** In some GenAI systems the encoding formats are called embedding types. Also, some GenAI systems only accept a single format per request.

**[13] `gen_ai.response.model`:** If available. The name of the GenAI model that provided the response. If the model is supplied by a vendor, then the value must be the exact name of the model actually used. If the model is a fine-tuned custom model, the value should have a more specific name than the base model that's been fine-tuned.

**[14] `gen_ai.thread.id`:** If available.

`gen_ai.thread.id` is usually available on the spans that describe operations
performed on the thread such as `create_thread` or `process_thread_run`.

Instrumentations of the low level GenAI inference operations such as
`chat` or `text_completion` done by the lower-level clients usually
don't have thread id available. If it's available, it SHOULD be set.

**[15] `gen_ai.thread.run.id`:** If available.

`gen_ai.thread.run.id` is usually available on the spans that describe
thread runs such as `process_thread_run` or `start_thread_run`.

Instrumentations of the low level GenAI inference operations such as
`chat` or `text_completion` done by the lower-level clients usually
don't have thread run id available. If it's available, it SHOULD be set.

**[16] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[17] `server.address`:** if available and if operation involves remote calls against GenAI service.

|---|---|---|
| `chat` | Chat completion operation such as [OpenAI Chat API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `create_agent` | Create GenAI agent | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `create_message` | Create a message in a thread [18] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `create_thread` | Create GenAI thread | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `embeddings` | Embeddings operation such as [OpenAI Create embeddings API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings/create) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `execute_tool` | Execute a tool [19] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `process_thread_run` | Create and process a thread run on the agent [20] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `start_thread_run` | Create thread run [21] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `submit_tool_outputs` | Submit tool calls results to a run [22] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `text_completion` | Text completions operation such as [OpenAI Completions API (Legacy)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[18]:** This operation SHOULD be used when message creation involves remote call to store this message, but does not result in model generating response. It SHOULD NOT be reported along with `chat`, `text_completion` or other inference operations.

**[19]:** This operation describes the tool execution which usually is a client operation performed by the application code.
Instrumentations SHOULD record this operation when possible - for example, when they provide convenience methods for executing custom tools or provide built-in tools executed on the client side.

**[20]:** The run may consist of multiple steps such as calls to model or tool calls which may be executed on the client side by the application or GenAI client framework or remotely on the GenAI agent.
The instrumented operation SHOULD cover full duration of the run including time awaiting the final completion. It SHOULD be reported for streaming runs and for operations that involve polling the run status.

**[21]:** The run may consist of multiple steps such as calls to model or tool calls which may be executed on the client side by the application or GenAI client framework or remotely on the GenAI agent.
Unlike `process_thread_run` this operation covers the creation of the thread run and does not include time awaiting the completion of the run.
Instrumentations SHOULD report `process_thread_run` operation instead of `create_thread_run` whenever it is possible.

**[22]:** This operation SHOULD be used when instrumentation can determine that application is submitting the tool call output to the model, for example, when this operation is reported in the context of agent thread run.
When application is submitting the tool call output with the generic GenAI call such as `chat` or `text_completion`, the instrumentation SHOULD use the corresponding operation name since it cannot reliably determine the intent behind the generic GenAI call.

## Capturing inputs and outputs

User inputs and model responses may be recorded as events parented to GenAI operation span. See [Semantic Conventions for GenAI events](./gen-ai-events.md) for the details.

## Composite Generative AI scenarios

Generative AI applications use patterns like
[RAG](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation) that involve
multiple operations such as GenAI or database calls. They also may need to store
conversation history which also involves communication with multiple services.

These patterns could be implemented in the application code, client framework
such as [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) or on the managed
service such as [OpenAI Assistants](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants),
[Azure AI Agents](TODO link), or [Amazon Bedrock Agents](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/).

Semantic conventions for agents and local composite scenarios are covered in the [GenAI agent spans](./gen-ai-agent-spans.md)
document.

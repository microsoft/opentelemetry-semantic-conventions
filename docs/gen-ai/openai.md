**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

Semantic Conventions for [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) client spans extend and override the semantic conventions for [Gen AI Spans](gen-ai-spans.md).

`gen_ai.system` MUST be set to `"openai"` and SHOULD be provided **at span creation time**.

**Span name** SHOULD be `{gen_ai.operation.name} {gen_ai.request.model}`.

**Span kind** SHOULD be `CLIENT`.

**Span status** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.

**[1] `gen_ai.operation.name`:** If one of the predefined values applies, but specific system uses a different name it's RECOMMENDED to document it in the semantic conventions for specific GenAI system and use system-specific name in the instrumentation. If a different name is not documented, instrumentation libraries SHOULD use applicable predefined value.

**[2] `gen_ai.request.model`:** The name of the GenAI model a request is being made to. If the model is supplied by a vendor, then the value must be the exact name of the model requested. If the model is a fine-tuned custom model, the value should have a more specific name than the base model that's been fine-tuned.

**[3] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the error code returned by the Generative AI provider or the client library,
the canonical name of exception that occurred, or another low-cardinality error identifier.
Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

**[4] `gen_ai.openai.request.service_tier`:** if the request includes a service_tier and the value is not 'auto'

**[5] `gen_ai.openai.response.service_tier`:** if the response was received and includes a service_tier

**[6] `gen_ai.output.type`:** This attribute SHOULD be set to the output type requested by the client:
- `json` for structured outputs with defined or undefined schema
- `image` for image output
- `speech` for speech output
- `text` for plain text output

The attribute specifies the output modality and not the actual output format.
For example, if an image is requested, the actual output could be a
URL pointing to an image file.

Additional output format details may be recorded in the future in the
`gen_ai.output.{type}.*` attributes.

**[7] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[8] `gen_ai.message.id`:** For inference operations such as `chat` or `text_completion`, it SHOULD be the completion identifier returned by the GenAI system and may not be unique if multiple choices are returned.
If message history is managed by the application, agent, or framework, it SHOULD match the identifier used by the message history management system.

**[9] `gen_ai.response.model`:** If available. The name of the GenAI model that provided the response. If the model is supplied by a vendor, then the value must be the exact name of the model actually used. If the model is a fine-tuned custom model, the value should have a more specific name than the base model that's been fine-tuned.

**[10] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[11] `server.address`:** if available and if operation involves remote calls against GenAI service.

`error.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

|---|---|---|
| `_OTHER` | A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

---

`gen_ai.openai.request.service_tier` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `auto` | The system will utilize scale tier credits until they are exhausted. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `default` | The system will utilize the default scale tier. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

---

`gen_ai.operation.name` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `chat` | Chat completion operation such as [OpenAI Chat API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `create_agent` | Create GenAI agent | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `create_message` | Create a message in a thread [12] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `create_thread` | Create GenAI thread | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `embeddings` | Embeddings operation such as [OpenAI Create embeddings API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings/create) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `execute_tool` | Execute a tool [13] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `generate_content` | Multimodal content generation operation such as [Gemini Generate Content](https://ai.google.dev/api/generate-content) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `invoke_agent` | Invoke GenAI agent | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `process_thread_run` | Create and process a thread run on the agent [14] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `start_thread_run` | Create thread run [15] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `submit_tool_outputs` | Submit tool calls results to a run [16] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `text_completion` | Text completions operation such as [OpenAI Completions API (Legacy)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[12]:** This operation SHOULD be used when message creation involves remote call to store this message, but does not result in model generating response. It SHOULD NOT be reported along with `chat`, `text_completion` or other inference operations.

**[13]:** This operation describes the tool execution which usually is a client operation performed by the application code.
Instrumentations SHOULD record this operation when possible - for example, when they provide convenience methods for executing custom tools or provide built-in tools executed on the client side.

**[14]:** The run may consist of multiple steps such as calls to model or tool calls which may be executed on the client side by the application or GenAI client framework or remotely on the GenAI agent.
The instrumented operation SHOULD cover full duration of the run including time awaiting the final completion. It SHOULD be reported for streaming runs and for operations that involve polling the run status.

**[15]:** The run may consist of multiple steps such as calls to model or tool calls which may be executed on the client side by the application or GenAI client framework or remotely on the GenAI agent.
Unlike `process_thread_run` this operation covers the creation of the thread run and does not include time awaiting the completion of the run.
Instrumentations SHOULD report `process_thread_run` operation instead of `create_thread_run` whenever it is possible.

**[16]:** This operation SHOULD be used when instrumentation can determine that application is submitting the tool call output to the model, for example, when this operation is reported in the context of agent thread run.
When application is submitting the tool call output with the generic GenAI call such as `chat` or `text_completion`, the instrumentation SHOULD use the corresponding operation name since it cannot reliably determine the intent behind the generic GenAI call.

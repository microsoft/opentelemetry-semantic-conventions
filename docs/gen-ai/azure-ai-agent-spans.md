Generative AI scenarios may involve multiple steps. For example RAG pattern implementation usually involves
the following steps:

- initial request to the GenAI model to rewrite user query
- getting embeddings for the rewritten query
- searching for similar documents in the vector store using embeddings
- getting completion from the GenAI model based on the similar documents.

These steps may be done by the application itself using GenAI models and vector databases.
It's also common to leverage client framework such as [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph)
or service offerings such as [OpenAI Assistants](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants),
[Azure AI Agents](TODO link), or [Amazon Bedrock Agents](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/).

This document defines semantic conventions for GenAI agent calls that are
handled by the remote agent service.
It MAY be applicable to agent operations that are performed by the GenAI
framework locally.

The semantic conventions for GenAI agents extend and override the semantic conventions
for [Gen AI Spans](gen-ai-spans.md).

## Events

> [NOTE!]
>
> Since logs and events API is not stable in at least some languages including Python,
> Azure AI Agent instrumentations MAY report [GenAI events](./gen-ai-events.md) on
> span events instead.
>
> When span events are used, the event body MUST be reported as a JSON string on the
> `gen_ai.event.content` attribute.

## Spans

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

Describes GenAI agent creation and is usually applicable when working with remote agent services.

The `gen_ai.operation.name` SHOULD be `create_agent`.

**Span name** SHOULD be `create_agent {gen_ai.agent.name}`.
Semantic conventions for individual GenAI systems and frameworks MAY specify different span name format.

**Span kind** SHOULD be `CLIENT`.

**Span status** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`gen_ai.operation.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/gen-ai.md) | string | The name of the operation being performed. [1] | `chat`; `generate_content`; `text_completion` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`gen_ai.system`](/docs/attributes-registry/gen-ai.md) | string | The Generative AI product as identified by the client or server instrumentation. [2] | `openai` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`error.type`](/docs/attributes-registry/error.md) | string | Describes a class of error the operation ended with. [3] | `timeout`; `java.net.UnknownHostException`; `server_certificate_invalid`; `500` | `Conditionally Required` if the operation ended in an error | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`gen_ai.agent.description`](/docs/attributes-registry/gen-ai.md) | string | Free-form description of the GenAI agent provided by the application. | `Helps with math problems`; `Generates fiction stories` | `Conditionally Required` If provided by the application. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`gen_ai.agent.id`](/docs/attributes-registry/gen-ai.md) | string | The unique identifier of the GenAI agent. | `asst_5j66UpCpwteGg4YSxUnt7lPY` | `Conditionally Required` if applicable. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`gen_ai.agent.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/gen-ai.md) | string | Human-readable name of the GenAI agent provided by the application. | `Math Tutor`; `Fiction Writer` | `Conditionally Required` If provided by the application. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`gen_ai.request.model`](/docs/attributes-registry/gen-ai.md) | string | The name of the GenAI model a request is being made to. [4] | `gpt-4` | `Conditionally Required` If available. | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`server.port`](/docs/attributes-registry/server.md) | int | GenAI server port. [5] | `80`; `8080`; `443` | `Conditionally Required` If `server.address` is set. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |
| [`server.address`](/docs/attributes-registry/server.md) | string | GenAI server address. [6] | `example.com`; `10.1.2.80`; `/tmp/my.sock` | `Recommended` [7] | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

**[1] `gen_ai.operation.name`:** If one of the predefined values applies, but specific system uses a different name it's RECOMMENDED to document it in the semantic conventions for specific GenAI system and use system-specific name in the instrumentation. If a different name is not documented, instrumentation libraries SHOULD use applicable predefined value.

**[2] `gen_ai.system`:** The `gen_ai.system` describes a family of GenAI models with specific model identified
by `gen_ai.request.model` and `gen_ai.response.model` attributes.

The actual GenAI product may differ from the one identified by the client.
Multiple systems, including Azure OpenAI and Gemini, are accessible by OpenAI client
libraries. In such cases, the `gen_ai.system` is set to `openai` based on the
instrumentation's best knowledge, instead of the actual system. The `server.address`
attribute may help identify the actual system in use for `openai`.

For custom model, a custom friendly name SHOULD be used.
If none of these options apply, the `gen_ai.system` SHOULD be set to `_OTHER`.

**[3] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the error code returned by the Generative AI provider or the client library,
the canonical name of exception that occurred, or another low-cardinality error identifier.
Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

**[4] `gen_ai.request.model`:** The name of the GenAI model a request is being made to. If the model is supplied by a vendor, then the value must be the exact name of the model requested. If the model is a fine-tuned custom model, the value should have a more specific name than the base model that's been fine-tuned.

**[5] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[6] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[7] `server.address`:** if available and if operation involves remote calls against GenAI service.

---

`error.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `_OTHER` | A fallback error value to be used when the instrumentation doesn't define a custom value. | ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/-stable-lightgreen) |

---

`gen_ai.operation.name` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| Value  | Description | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| `chat` | Chat completion operation such as [OpenAI Chat API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `create_agent` | Create GenAI agent | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `create_message` | Create a message in a thread [8] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `create_thread` | Create GenAI thread | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `embeddings` | Embeddings operation such as [OpenAI Create embeddings API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings/create) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `execute_tool` | Execute a tool [9] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `generate_content` | Multimodal content generation operation such as [Gemini Generate Content](https://ai.google.dev/api/generate-content) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `invoke_agent` | Invoke GenAI agent | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `process_thread_run` | Create and process a thread run on the agent [10] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `start_thread_run` | Create thread run [11] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `submit_tool_outputs` | Submit tool calls results to a run [12] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `text_completion` | Text completions operation such as [OpenAI Completions API (Legacy)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[8]:** This operation SHOULD be used when message creation involves remote call to store this message, but does not result in model generating response. It SHOULD NOT be reported along with `chat`, `text_completion` or other inference operations.

**[9]:** This operation describes the tool execution which usually is a client operation performed by the application code.
Instrumentations SHOULD record this operation when possible - for example, when they provide convenience methods for executing custom tools or provide built-in tools executed on the client side.

**[10]:** The run may consist of multiple steps such as calls to model or tool calls which may be executed on the client side by the application or GenAI client framework or remotely on the GenAI agent.
The instrumented operation SHOULD cover full duration of the run including time awaiting the final completion. It SHOULD be reported for streaming runs and for operations that involve polling the run status.

**[11]:** The run may consist of multiple steps such as calls to model or tool calls which may be executed on the client side by the application or GenAI client framework or remotely on the GenAI agent.
Unlike `process_thread_run` this operation covers the creation of the thread run and does not include time awaiting the completion of the run.
Instrumentations SHOULD report `process_thread_run` operation instead of `create_thread_run` whenever it is possible.

**[12]:** This operation SHOULD be used when instrumentation can determine that application is submitting the tool call output to the model, for example, when this operation is reported in the context of agent thread run.
When application is submitting the tool call output with the generic GenAI call such as `chat` or `text_completion`, the instrumentation SHOULD use the corresponding operation name since it cannot reliably determine the intent behind the generic GenAI call.

**[1] `gen_ai.operation.name`:** If one of the predefined values applies, but specific system uses a different name it's RECOMMENDED to document it in the semantic conventions for specific GenAI system and use system-specific name in the instrumentation. If a different name is not documented, instrumentation libraries SHOULD use applicable predefined value.

**[2] `gen_ai.system`:** The `gen_ai.system` describes a family of GenAI models with specific model identified
by `gen_ai.request.model` and `gen_ai.response.model` attributes.

The actual GenAI product may differ from the one identified by the client.
Multiple systems, including Azure OpenAI and Gemini, are accessible by OpenAI client
libraries. In such cases, the `gen_ai.system` is set to `openai` based on the
instrumentation's best knowledge, instead of the actual system. The `server.address`
attribute may help identify the actual system in use for `openai`.

For custom model, a custom friendly name SHOULD be used.
If none of these options apply, the `gen_ai.system` SHOULD be set to `_OTHER`.

**[3] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the error code returned by the Generative AI provider or the client library,
the canonical name of exception that occurred, or another low-cardinality error identifier.
Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

**[4] `gen_ai.data_source.id`:** Data sources are used by AI agents and RAG applications to store grounding data. A data source may be an external database, object store, document collection, website, or any other storage system used by the GenAI agent or application. The `gen_ai.data_source.id` SHOULD match the identifier used by the GenAI system rather than a name specific to the external storage, such as a database or object store. Semantic conventions referencing `gen_ai.data_source.id` MAY also leverage additional attributes, such as `db.*`, to further identify and describe the data source.

**[5] `gen_ai.output.type`:** This attribute SHOULD be used when the client requests output of a specific type. The model may return zero or more outputs of this type.
This attribute specifies the output modality and not the actual output format. For example, if an image is requested, the actual output could be a URL pointing to an image file.
Additional output format details may be recorded in the future in the `gen_ai.output.{type}.*` attributes.

**[6] `gen_ai.output.type`:** when applicable and if the request includes an output format.

**[7] `gen_ai.request.model`:** The name of the GenAI model a request is being made to. If the model is supplied by a vendor, then the value must be the exact name of the model requested. If the model is a fine-tuned custom model, the value should have a more specific name than the base model that's been fine-tuned.

**[8] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[9] `gen_ai.message.id`:** For inference operations such as `chat` or `text_completion`, it SHOULD be the completion identifier returned by the GenAI system and may not be unique if multiple choices are returned.
If message history is managed by the application, agent, or framework, it SHOULD match the identifier used by the message history management system.

**[10] `gen_ai.response.model`:** If available. The name of the GenAI model that provided the response. If the model is supplied by a vendor, then the value must be the exact name of the model actually used. If the model is a fine-tuned custom model, the value should have a more specific name than the base model that's been fine-tuned.

**[11] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[12] `server.address`:** if available and if operation involves remote calls against GenAI service.

**[13]:** This operation SHOULD be used when message creation involves remote call to store this message, but does not result in model generating response. It SHOULD NOT be reported along with `chat`, `text_completion` or other inference operations.

**[14]:** This operation describes the tool execution which usually is a client operation performed by the application code.
Instrumentations SHOULD record this operation when possible - for example, when they provide convenience methods for executing custom tools or provide built-in tools executed on the client side.

**[15]:** The run may consist of multiple steps such as calls to model or tool calls which may be executed on the client side by the application or GenAI client framework or remotely on the GenAI agent.
The instrumented operation SHOULD cover full duration of the run including time awaiting the final completion. It SHOULD be reported for streaming runs and for operations that involve polling the run status.

**[16]:** The run may consist of multiple steps such as calls to model or tool calls which may be executed on the client side by the application or GenAI client framework or remotely on the GenAI agent.
Unlike `process_thread_run` this operation covers the creation of the thread run and does not include time awaiting the completion of the run.
Instrumentations SHOULD report `process_thread_run` operation instead of `create_thread_run` whenever it is possible.

**[17]:** This operation SHOULD be used when instrumentation can determine that application is submitting the tool call output to the model, for example, when this operation is reported in the context of agent thread run.
When application is submitting the tool call output with the generic GenAI call such as `chat` or `text_completion`, the instrumentation SHOULD use the corresponding operation name since it cannot reliably determine the intent behind the generic GenAI call.

**[1] `gen_ai.operation.name`:** If one of the predefined values applies, but specific system uses a different name it's RECOMMENDED to document it in the semantic conventions for specific GenAI system and use system-specific name in the instrumentation. If a different name is not documented, instrumentation libraries SHOULD use applicable predefined value.

**[2] `gen_ai.system`:** The `gen_ai.system` describes a family of GenAI models with specific model identified
by `gen_ai.request.model` and `gen_ai.response.model` attributes.

The actual GenAI product may differ from the one identified by the client.
Multiple systems, including Azure OpenAI and Gemini, are accessible by OpenAI client
libraries. In such cases, the `gen_ai.system` is set to `openai` based on the
instrumentation's best knowledge, instead of the actual system. The `server.address`
attribute may help identify the actual system in use for `openai`.

For custom model, a custom friendly name SHOULD be used.
If none of these options apply, the `gen_ai.system` SHOULD be set to `_OTHER`.

**[3] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the error code returned by the Generative AI provider or the client library,
the canonical name of exception that occurred, or another low-cardinality error identifier.
Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

**[4] `gen_ai.request.model`:** The name of the GenAI model a request is being made to. If the model is supplied by a vendor, then the value must be the exact name of the model requested. If the model is a fine-tuned custom model, the value should have a more specific name than the base model that's been fine-tuned.

**[5] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[6] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[7] `server.address`:** if available and if operation involves remote calls against GenAI service.

**[1] `gen_ai.operation.name`:** If one of the predefined values applies, but specific system uses a different name it's RECOMMENDED to document it in the semantic conventions for specific GenAI system and use system-specific name in the instrumentation. If a different name is not documented, instrumentation libraries SHOULD use applicable predefined value.

**[2] `gen_ai.system`:** The `gen_ai.system` describes a family of GenAI models with specific model identified
by `gen_ai.request.model` and `gen_ai.response.model` attributes.

The actual GenAI product may differ from the one identified by the client.
Multiple systems, including Azure OpenAI and Gemini, are accessible by OpenAI client
libraries. In such cases, the `gen_ai.system` is set to `openai` based on the
instrumentation's best knowledge, instead of the actual system. The `server.address`
attribute may help identify the actual system in use for `openai`.

For custom model, a custom friendly name SHOULD be used.
If none of these options apply, the `gen_ai.system` SHOULD be set to `_OTHER`.

**[3] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the error code returned by the Generative AI provider or the client library,
the canonical name of exception that occurred, or another low-cardinality error identifier.
Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

**[4] `gen_ai.request.model`:** The name of the GenAI model a request is being made to. If the model is supplied by a vendor, then the value must be the exact name of the model requested. If the model is a fine-tuned custom model, the value should have a more specific name than the base model that's been fine-tuned.

**[5] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[6] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[7] `server.address`:** if available and if operation involves remote calls against GenAI service.

`error.type` has the following list of well-known values. If one of them applies, then the respective value MUST be used; otherwise, a custom value MAY be used.

| `submit_tool_outputs` | Submit tool calls results to a run [12] | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| `text_completion` | Text completions operation such as [OpenAI Completions API (Legacy)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[8]:** This operation SHOULD be used when message creation involves remote call to store this message, but does not result in model generating response. It SHOULD NOT be reported along with `chat`, `text_completion` or other inference operations.

**[9]:** This operation describes the tool execution which usually is a client operation performed by the application code.
Instrumentations SHOULD record this operation when possible - for example, when they provide convenience methods for executing custom tools or provide built-in tools executed on the client side.

**[10]:** The run may consist of multiple steps such as calls to model or tool calls which may be executed on the client side by the application or GenAI client framework or remotely on the GenAI agent.
The instrumented operation SHOULD cover full duration of the run including time awaiting the final completion. It SHOULD be reported for streaming runs and for operations that involve polling the run status.

**[11]:** The run may consist of multiple steps such as calls to model or tool calls which may be executed on the client side by the application or GenAI client framework or remotely on the GenAI agent.
Unlike `process_thread_run` this operation covers the creation of the thread run and does not include time awaiting the completion of the run.
Instrumentations SHOULD report `process_thread_run` operation instead of `create_thread_run` whenever it is possible.

**[12]:** This operation SHOULD be used when instrumentation can determine that application is submitting the tool call output to the model, for example, when this operation is reported in the context of agent thread run.
When application is submitting the tool call output with the generic GenAI call such as `chat` or `text_completion`, the instrumentation SHOULD use the corresponding operation name since it cannot reliably determine the intent behind the generic GenAI call.

**[12]:** The run may consist of multiple steps such as calls to model or tool calls which may be executed on the client side by the application or GenAI client framework or remotely on the GenAI agent.
Unlike `process_thread_run` this operation covers the creation of the thread run and does not include time awaiting the completion of the run.
Instrumentations SHOULD report `process_thread_run` operation instead of `create_thread_run` whenever it is possible.

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

Describes tool execution span.

`gen_ai.operation.name` SHOULD be `execute_tool`.

**Span name** SHOULD be `execute_tool {gen_ai.tool.name}`.

GenAI instrumentations that are able to instrument tool execution call SHOULD do so.

However, it's common for tools to be executed by the application code. It's recommended
for the application developers to follow this semantic convention for tools invoked
by the application code.

**Span kind** SHOULD be `INTERNAL`.

**Span status** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`error.type`](/docs/attributes-registry/error.md) | string | Describes a class of error the operation ended with.

**[1] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the error code returned by the Generative AI provider or the client library,
the canonical name of exception that occurred, or another low-cardinality error identifier.
Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

**Status:** ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue)

Describes submission of the tool outputs to the GenAI agent and is usually applicable when working with remote agents.

The `gen_ai.operation.name` MUST be `submit_tool_outputs`.
The **span name** SHOULD be `submit_tool_outputs`.
Semantic conventions for individual GenAI systems and frameworks MAY specify different span name format.
This span SHOULD be reported when instrumentation can determine that application is submitting the tool call output to the model.
When application is submitting the tool call output with the generic GenAI call such as `chat` or `text_completion`, the instrumentation SHOULD report generic GenAI span since it cannot reliably determine the intent behind the generic GenAI call.

**Span kind** SHOULD be `CLIENT`.

**Span status** SHOULD follow the [Recording Errors](/docs/general/recording-errors.md) document.

| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`gen_ai.operation.name`](/docs/attributes-registry/gen-ai.md) | string | The name of the operation being performed. [1] | `chat`; `generate_content`; `text_completion` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`gen_ai.system`](/docs/attributes-registry/gen-ai.md) | string | The Generative AI product as identified by the client or server instrumentation. [2] | `openai` | `Required` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `gen_ai.operation.name`:** If one of the predefined values applies, but specific system uses a different name it's RECOMMENDED to document it in the semantic conventions for specific GenAI system and use system-specific name in the instrumentation. If a different name is not documented, instrumentation libraries SHOULD use applicable predefined value.

**[2] `gen_ai.system`:** The `gen_ai.system` describes a family of GenAI models with specific model identified
by `gen_ai.request.model` and `gen_ai.response.model` attributes.

The actual GenAI product may differ from the one identified by the client.
Multiple systems, including Azure OpenAI and Gemini, are accessible by OpenAI client
libraries. In such cases, the `gen_ai.system` is set to `openai` based on the
instrumentation's best knowledge, instead of the actual system. The `server.address`
attribute may help identify the actual system in use for `openai`.

For custom model, a custom friendly name SHOULD be used.
If none of these options apply, the `gen_ai.system` SHOULD be set to `_OTHER`.

**[3] `error.type`:** The `error.type` SHOULD match the error code returned by the Generative AI provider or the client library,
the canonical name of exception that occurred, or another low-cardinality error identifier.
Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

**[4] `gen_ai.request.model`:** The name of the GenAI model a request is being made to. If the model is supplied by a vendor, then the value must be the exact name of the model requested. If the model is a fine-tuned custom model, the value should have a more specific name than the base model that's been fine-tuned.

**[5] `server.port`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.port` SHOULD represent the server port behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[6] `server.address`:** When observed from the client side, and when communicating through an intermediary, `server.address` SHOULD represent the server address behind any intermediaries, for example proxies, if it's available.

**[7] `server.address`:** if available and if operation involves remote calls against GenAI service.

The the following events MAY be reported as a child of this span when corresponding
details are available:

- [`gen_ai.tool.message`](./gen-ai-events.md#event-gen_aitoolmessage) -
  captures tool responses submitted to the model during this step.
- [`gen_ai.assistant.message`](./gen-ai-events.md#event-gen_aiassistantmessage) -
  captures assistant messages generated in response to tool submission.

  Depending on the application code, the `submit_tool_outputs` span may cover the
  time to submit tool outputs only or may include the process of receiving next
  response based on the provided outputs. The `gen_ai.assistant.message` could only
  be reported under `submit_tool_outputs` span when the corresponding operation
  covers receiving the assistant message.

When `submit_tool_outputs` span is reported along with
[`process_thread_run` span](#process-thread-run-span), the `gen_ai.tool.message`
and `gen_ai.assistant.message` events SHOULD, when possible, be reported as
children of `process_thread_run` span.

## Examples

### Backend-side RAG

This example demonstrates GenAI GitHub bot that, based on the documentation,
can provide basic support tasks on the repository.

1. Application creates the agent: it uploads documentation that bot will use
   as the knowledge base and creates and configures the agent.

   ![create_agent_rag.png](./images/create-agent-rag.png)

   The remote agent definition is usually long lived and is reused across
   multiple thread runs.

   Corresponding `crete_agent` span is annotated with
   `gen_ai.agent.id` that can be used for cross-correlation with thread runs on that
   agent. The instructions provided at the agent creation time are recorded in
   `gen_ai.system.message`.

2. When a new issue created in the repository, the application creates a thread
   which will contain conversation history about this issue between the
   application and assistant.
   Once thread is created, the application starts the thread run and awaits its
   completion. It then uses generated response to post a comment on the GitHub issue.

   ![create_and_run_thread.png](./images/create-and-run-thread.png)

   Thread creation and processing spans are annotated with `gen_ai.thread.id`
   attribute which can be used to filter and correlate runs and messages associated
   with this thread.

   One on more user message may be provided at different stages (on `create_thread`,
   `process_thread_run` or via an additional `create_message` call). Corresponding
   `gen_ai.user.message` event(s) are reported as children of the corresponding span.

   If new or additional instructions are provided at the thread run time, they are
   reported on `gen_ai.system.message` event parented to the `process_thread_run`
   span.

3. If the author of the issue posts another comment on the issue, the application
   creates a new message with the user reply on the same thread it created in the Step 2.
   Then it starts a new run and awaits its completion.

   ![another_run_on_the_thread.png](./images/another-run-on-the-thread.png)

### GenAI agent with tool calls

This example shows trace with the GitHub support bot that supports tool calling and
performs a tool call during the run. In this example, the application uses agent API
that awaits run processing till completion and is able to record all the messages
generated during the run.

Agent creation is omitted for brevity.

![run_with_tool_calls_and_streaming.png](./images/run-with-tool-calls-and-streaming.png)

When a new issue is created in the repository, the application creates a new thread
with the issue description as a user message. Then it starts and processes a thread
run.

The agent starts processing and then returns `action_required` status with tool call
request that instrumentation records under `gen_ai.assistant.message` event.

Application executes the tool call (reported as `execute_tool get_customer_info`)
and submits tool outputs. The `gen_ai.tool.message` event is recorded for each
executed tool as a child of `submit_tool_outputs` span.

when the final response is received from the agent, it's recorded as `gen_ai.assistant.message`
event parented to `process_thread_run` span.

### GenAI agent with tool calls without streaming

This example is similar to the [GenAI agent with tool calls](#genai-agent-with-tool-calls),
but demonstrates the case when application starts a run and then polls its status.
When it detects that run required action, it performs a tool call, submits the output
and then polls run status again until it completes.

Upon run completion, it lists messages on the thread to retrieve the GenAI completion
generated by the agent.

Agent creation is omitted for brevity.

![run_with_tool_calls_without_streaming.png](./images/run-with-tool-calls-without-streaming.png)

Since in this case application code does not await run completion as a single operation,
the automatic instrumentation is not able to instrument the whole run duration.

Instead, the instrumentation creates spans for each agent operation (`start_thread_run`,
`retrieve_run`, `list_messages`, etc) and reports message events under the corresponding
spans.
